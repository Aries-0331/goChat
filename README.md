# goChat
This project is a practice based on [Create A Real Time Chat App With Golang, Angular, And Websockets](https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/12/create-real-time-chat-app-golang-angular-2-websockets/), and most of the code are from Nic Raboy. What i've done is just typing, fix some deprecated APIs after Angular5+, and make it run.

# Requirements
- [Golang 1.7+](https://golang.org/)
- [Node.js 4.0+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [The Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)

# Take a look
1. open a terminal and run `go run main.go` in the project path
2. open another terminal, get into SocketExampe and run `ng serve`
3. then navigate to `http://localhost:4200` in your web browser
